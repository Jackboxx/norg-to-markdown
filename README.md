# Norg to Markdown
This is a simple CLI tool to convert [.norg](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/norg-specs/blob/main/1.0-specification.norg) files to [GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/). 

This tool is in the very early stages of development so many things don't work yet.

### What works
- highlighting (bold, italic)
- unordered lists
- ordered lists
- headers
